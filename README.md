    <li> <i>First we will make encodings of all the images that have been registered before</i></li>
    <li> <i>To register a user simply put their image in registered folder with enrolment number as the name of image</i></li>
    <li> <i>There is a folder named registered user, in that folder we will have all the people that are registered previously, the file are named based on their enrolment number</i></li>
  </ul>
 <b>for e.g. kishan's image will be named 124125512.jpg, where 124125512 is the enrolment number</b>
